## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to the Task Management System. This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to the project with a focus on security, quality, and compliance requirements.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and professional environment. All contributors must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please review it before contributing.

## Security Requirements

### Security Standards
- All code must comply with OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Implement security headers and CSP policies
- Follow secure coding practices for input validation and output encoding
- Maintain PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2 compliance requirements

### Security Testing Requirements
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using SonarQube
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using OWASP ZAP
- Dependency vulnerability scanning using Snyk
- Container security scanning using Trivy
- Security unit tests for authentication and authorization

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x)
- Java JDK 17
- Docker (latest version)
- Git (latest version)
- IDE with security linting support
- Security scanning tools:
  - Snyk CLI
  - SonarQube Scanner
  - OWASP Dependency-Check

### Environment Configuration
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
cd src/web && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
```
3. Configure security tools:
```bash
npm run security-init
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature: `feature/TASK-123-description`
- Bugfix: `fix/TASK-123-description`
- Security: `security/TASK-123-description`
- Compliance: `compliance/TASK-123-description`

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, security

### Code Style Guidelines
- Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- Use ESLint with security rules enabled
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use dependency injection for better testability

## Testing Requirements

### Security Testing
- Run security scans before commits:
```bash
npm run security-scan
```
- Maintain minimum 80% test coverage
- Include security-focused test cases
- Test for common vulnerabilities

### Performance Testing
- API response time < 500ms
- Page load time < 2s
- Memory usage within defined thresholds
- Load testing with specified concurrent users

### Compliance Testing
- GDPR compliance validation
- PCI DSS requirement testing
- SOC 2 control validation
- Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1)

## Compliance Guidelines

### Data Protection
- Implement data encryption at rest
- Secure data transmission using TLS 1.3
- Follow data retention policies
- Implement proper data access controls

### Audit Requirements
- Maintain comprehensive audit logs
- Implement audit trail for sensitive operations
- Follow compliance documentation requirements
- Regular compliance reviews

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes following security guidelines
3. Run security and compliance checks:
```bash
npm run pre-pr-checks
```
4. Update documentation and CHANGELOG
5. Submit PR using the template
6. Pass security review and compliance validation
7. Obtain required approvals

### PR Requirements
- Security scan results attached
- Test coverage report
- Compliance validation results
- Performance test results
- Updated documentation

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement MFA where applicable
- Use secure session management
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Implement proper access controls

### Data Security
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement input validation
- Apply output encoding
- Secure file handling

### Infrastructure Security
- Follow container security guidelines
- Implement network security policies
- Use secure configuration management
- Regular security patching

### Monitoring & Logging
- Implement security monitoring
- Configure proper log levels
- Follow secure logging practices
- Set up security alerts
