## Architecture

The system implements a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with Material-UI
- **API Gateway**: Kong Gateway with rate limiting and security
- **Microservices**:
  - Authentication Service (Node.js)
  - Task Service (Java/Spring Boot)
  - Project Service (Java/Spring Boot)
  - Notification Service (Node.js)
  - Search Service (Elasticsearch)

- **Data Layer**:
  - PostgreSQL for transactional data
  - Redis for caching
  - Elasticsearch for search
  - RabbitMQ for messaging

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Java 17 LTS
- Docker >= 20.10.0
- Kubernetes >= 1.24.0
- PostgreSQL >= 14.0
- Redis >= 7.0
- RabbitMQ >= 3.12
